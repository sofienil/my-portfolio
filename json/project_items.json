Extended BNF is an extended version of it, where (), [] and {} is used to improve readability and writablility. <br><br>Attribute grammar is when BNF or EBNF cannot be used. It's a special case grammar where we add a attribute into the grammar. e.g. <EXPR>[\\I] where \\I is the attribute. <br>It is not required to use attribute grammar. However, I saw it as a fun challenge. <br><br>Grammar:  <br>// <ID> -> a till รถ | \" \" | ' | , | . <br>// <EXPR> -> (EXPR) <br>//          | <ID>* <br>//          | <ID>{n} <br>//          | <ID> + <ID> <br>// special case expr <br>//          | <EXPR>[\\I] <-- attribute <br>//          | (<EXPR>)[}\\I] <-- attribute <br>//          | \\O{n}",
